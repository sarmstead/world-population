# Methodology
[Codcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) provided an optional [population_queries.sql](./population_queries.sql) file to be used with [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). 

I elected to use the [SQLite CLI](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) instead of DB Browser to run my SQL queries. I therefore did not use the [population_queries.sql](./population_queries.sql) file for this project.
